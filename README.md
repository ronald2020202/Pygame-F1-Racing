# Pygame-F1-Racing
Recreation of fun car game from a cheap phone bought on Amazon.

Collaboration with schoolmate, using pygame to draw pixels. 

This was made during a Hackathon.



**Overview:**

This game consists of moving cars down the lane of traffic, which you must traverse to survive. You cannot touch them. They slowly come down at first but slowly speed up. There is a scoring system based on how long you last, and a high score is also displayed.
